# Supabase BaaS for the hangboard timer application

The [Hangboard Timer application](https://github.com/raul-sauco/hangboard-timer) uses [Supabase](https://supabase.com) as a BaaS, this directory contains the infrastructure as code ready to get a local development environment set up and synched with the application code at any point of the Git history.

Is OK if this directory and the application code are out of sync on individual commits, but **try to keep it in sync before merging upstream and on tagged commits**.

Here are some useful links.
